            Trust is the bet that expected behavior will continue unsupervised. In manufacturing, trust is approximated through audits, certifications, history and personal connections. This works, but takes time, doesn't transfer to new relationships and requires infrastructure only incumbents can afford.
            Trust in manufacturing is slow, manual and expensive. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Atramento makes manufacturing trust instant, automatic and cheap. We do it by bypassing the entire trust industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Atramento watches factory network traffic. It learns from sensor readings
            what normal operation looks like, and predicts whether normality will continue over a given span of time. That is all.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get one number: what is the probability that this process will remain consistent over a certain timespan?

            <strong>For insurers:</strong> you can price risk on factories
            you've never visited through real-time information. Plug directly into your actuarial model.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>For buyers:</strong> you can trust a supplier on day 90
            instead of year 3. Easy comparison, switch when you need to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>For suppliers:</strong> you can prove yourself without
            expensive certifications or leaking operational IP. The process consistency is your credential.

            We do not provide dashboards, analytics platforms, integration projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide a predicted future process consistency based on historical process data, with the model adjusting in real time. Everything else is left to you.
